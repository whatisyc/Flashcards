## Notes

The challenging part for me was working with state. I had to understand how useState can be used not only for counting, but also for tracking which card is currently displayed and whether the card is showing the question or the answer.

I also had some difficulty creating the flip animation for the flashcard. It took time to understand how CSS properties like transform, perspective, position, and backface-visibility work together to make the card flip correctly.
